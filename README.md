# EconToolBox

​	This project is a collection of demos, functions, algorithms and other useful programs used in my research in economics. Most of them are developed in Julia. Maybe I will make it a registered package in the future. But for now, they are organized by folders: every folder is for one demo/function/algorithm/work flow, and each of them is named by `“yymmdd_DescriptionInPascalNotation”`.

​	Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
